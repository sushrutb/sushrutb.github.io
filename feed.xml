        <description>&lt;p&gt;What People Seem to Miss About India&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;development-is-hard&quot;&gt;Development is Hard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near Nashik, there are several tribal areas with dense forests, low education levels, and significant challenges in providing government services. One particular village lacked access to water. For 25 years, the government attempted to install a small pipeline. However, a few months after it was installed, local drunks would steal the pipe and sell it for scrap to buy alcohol. This cycle repeated over and over. Every few years, there would be significant protests, sometimes violent, demanding a water supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nashik-Yeola road was developed with a divider featuring thick plastic sheets instead of trees.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Within six months, all the plastic sheets were stolen for various purposes such as roofing and fencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is incredibly difficult to build and maintain infrastructure in non-urban areas. While government incompetence is one factor, the lack of buy-in from the people who benefit from these services is definitely important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;protesting-is-easy&quot;&gt;Protesting is Easy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4-5 trees on a road connecting important industrial areas to Nashik city. When this road was developed, there were numerous protests against cutting down these trees. People, many not from Nashik, filed court cases and won. Today, these trees still stand. So far, at least ten people have died due to accidents caused by these trees, and numerous others have been injured. These accidents almost always affect people from disadvantaged groups, who are more likely to be on the road during dark hours. In Nashik, winter fog can reduce visibility to almost nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For less than Rs 1.5 lakh (approximately USD 2000), you can organize a protest against almost any project you want.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Such protests can easily get media coverage. Given India’s tight social networks around caste and the still-functioning hierarchy, it is easy to buy a caste leader and incite them to protest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not remember a single project that was not delayed or affected by protests, whether it is building new schools or airports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of a protest should not be seen as a signal against the government or as evidence of a tyrannical government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;india-is-diverse&quot;&gt;India is Diverse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s diversity extends beyond the number of languages, religions, and other “macro” variables. In any 1 square kilometer area of a city, you will find people from extremely diverse socio-economic strata living together. Daily wage laborers and millionaires live in close proximity to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most countries use property taxes to economically segregate their citizens, leading to vastly different qualities of services for the rich and the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, the rich and poor alike receive the same services: bad roads, unreliable power supply, the same security, quality of education, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the rich can spend more to access better services in some areas, it is still a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The reason why this road was developed before the Nashik-Mumbai or Nashik-Pune roads is a separate issue related to corruption. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;When I was 15, I somehow ended up at a protest because one of my friends got paid 5 Rs for each person he brought! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Manifesto 2024</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is what I wish to government do in next 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;monopolize-violence&quot;&gt;Monopolize Violence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most important job of a government is to monopolize violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government in last 10 years has done a decent job on securing our borders, eliminating threats of terrorism, and reducing Naxalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this government, as well as all the governments before it has done terribly on eliminating mob violence. Any group, based on ideology, religion, profession, or other categories can bring our cities to standstill. We have had protestors occupy streets for months. We routinely see violence against religious celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of your political/religious affiliations you have to agree that there is just too much of mob violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just last year we saw little kids demanding beheading of a person. Little kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can look at evidence and you will find unlimited number of examples of mobs running rampage of all religious, political, and ethnic groups. Even in a small state like Manipur, gangs can acquire modern weapons and unleash a level of violence that can only be compared to a war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A modern factory was destroyed by workers to settle pay dispute instead of going to courts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you had a minor traffic incident, it is very common for situation to devolve into mob violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this has to stop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not let anyone occupy streets. Not for prayers, not for religious processions, not for protests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declare stone pelting an act of terrorism. Any structure that is found to support stone pelting, destroy it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase quality and quantity of policing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make necessary judicial reforms to bring swift justice to people who incite violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;energy&quot;&gt;Energy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most effective thing government can do to make India into a developed economy with thriving manufacturing and service sector is provide cheap and abundant energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only scalable way to achieve this is &lt;em&gt;nuclear power&lt;/em&gt;. Solar, wind, hydro are all good supplements. But unless we invest heavily into nuclear fission reactors and research of fusion reactors we will never have enough energy to scale it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;judicial-reforms&quot;&gt;Judicial reforms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any functioning government is not working well if it takes years, or decades to provide justice. It reduces overall trust in the system if disputes can not be settled.
It is very difficult to enforce contracts, which essential means people with economic and/or street power have lot more leverage over those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the supreme court really right authority to adjudicate on bail pleas? Or mandate facial masks? Or decide which trees can be cut and which can not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make clear lines of separation between executive and judiciary. Reform the public interest litigation framework to stop legal activism by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments are the biggest litigators in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reduce-bureaucratic-waste&quot;&gt;Reduce bureaucratic waste&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have one the largest footprint of bureaucracy. Only Germany may be larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to go to a dealership with say Aadhar and PAN card and drive off with a vehicle fully registered and compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To run a small business with less than 50 lacs in revenue, we still have to get TAN, PAN, DIN, KYC, EPFO, GST, and many other compliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is all this necessary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a person should be able to start and run a small business without even needing an accountant. For example in Australia I was able to do a side hustle without ever needing an accountant for a business that generated AUD 150K in top line revenue. It took me less than 30 mins to register the business and open a bank account, all online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can’t we achieve this in India? In India it took better part of 2 months to get that, after close to 100 signatures!
Explanation often is that people will take advantage and game the system. We can not thrive as a country if we design our systems to make it more difficult for crooks to take advantage and in the process make it difficult for vast majority of honest law abiding citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost always these insane levels of bureaucracy leads to corruption and waste of financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;education-and-government&quot;&gt;Education and government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are these two topics interlinked?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://byjus.com/govt-exams/list-of-government-exams-after-12/&quot;&gt;number of exams&lt;/a&gt; government or its subsidiary conducts to recruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is madness. This is complete and utter madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental reason behind why we are not doing well in number of governance areas is these exams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems with current system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does not attract top tier talent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does not remove low performers from their posts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most recruits have no real world experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good ideas do not spread quickly across the government organization. We still have been able to replicate Indore model of clean cities in the last 7 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to solve this is by scrapping the system altogether.
A very radical way to do this is model the government recruitment like any private enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have relevant degrees (say MBA), and minimum experience required for a given post, you can apply for a 5 year contract.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government can spend 6-12 months in training new recruits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide internship opportunities to prospective recruits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Permanent posts only after successfully completing contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;miscellaneous&quot;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sell every non-defense sector PSU. Each and every one of them, starting with BSNL.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even in defense sector PSU find ways to transfer knowledge to Indian companies. If we can build a nuclear submarine, we should have a thriving ship building sector.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only way to support vulnerable class is via cash. Let people decide whether they want to spend the money of gas or clothes or food. Government has no business in dictating behavior. Make it impossible for even state governments to provide freebies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reform tax code for individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only 2 GST rates. Rate is either zero or X (12.5%?). No cess. Focus on increasing top line and not skimming.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce size of large states like UP, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, WB. Ideally no state should have more than 30 MPs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All metro cities should be states.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expand railway network and invest in truly high speed railways with &amp;gt; 250KMPH. average speed. Given the demand for railways, it should not difficult to find private investors from Japan/EU to help build these out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No retrospective government actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Goa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/goa-sunset-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Goa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been living in Goa for more than 2 years now. As many people have asked how it is like living here, here’s a detailed post on the experience so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-goa&quot;&gt;Why Goa?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common question I have received is why I chose to move to Goa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Goa is a rural place with access to &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; all urban comforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;access-to-culture&quot;&gt;Access to culture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a fairly vibrant art scene, especially music. There are lots of indie artists, as well as a couple of large music festivals like Sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very good local theatre scene, mostly due to Kala Academy. Although almost all of it is in Marathi or Konkani, there is one very good theatre in Ponda, and 2 old but still functional theatres in Mapusa and Bicholim that often have performances of popular Marathi plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classical music is not as accessible, with only occasional performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Goan villages have their own festivals that are unique to them, and it is always interesting to participate in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flagship arts event in Goa, Serendipity Arts Festival, happens in the second half of December and features some amazing performances in theatre, music, and dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;infrastructure&quot;&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the large home broadband/fiber companies operate in Goa. However, there are a couple of local operators, and they are good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roads are narrow, but mostly okay. Even though petrol pumps are not as many, most shops will sell a bottle of petrol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plenty of rental apartments and houses are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food delivery apps have great coverage, providing plenty of options to order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;food&quot;&gt;Food&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good coffee and cafes are quite important to me. Goa, especially around Assagaon, Anjuna, and Vagator area, has lots of options.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of touristy areas, you will find plenty of very good and cheap food options. If you are either non-vegetarian or pescatarian, Goa has you covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is not just local Goan or Indian food; there are now plenty of options for most world cuisines. From Lebanese to Japanese to Fusion, there are lots of new restaurants catering to a variety of choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I do not drink much and very rarely drink cocktails, there is no shortage of choices there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Goa has a number of non-Indians visiting/living, it has better availability of exotic vegetables and fruits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many hobby groups and communities you can join based on interests. Dance is extremely popular here. Social events centered around dancing are quite accessible; just get a few lessons beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Winter, from November to February, many localities have open markets where local artists and creators showcase their work. There are a few permanent markets, such as Hill Top in Anjuna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a few book clubs, board-gaming groups, and quizzing groups are active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a member or ally of the LGBT+ community, then there are at least a couple of groups very active that organize socializing and awareness events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nature&quot;&gt;Nature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goa has many wonderful beaches. At least a few are not as busy as the main touristy beaches of Baga and Calangute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has lush green forests, hiking trails, waterfalls, and natural lakes. There is plenty to explore. There are a few abandoned quarries that become lakes during the monsoon, but do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; go swimming in them; they are quite dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of wildlife, especially birds, reptiles, and drunk humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sports-and-fitness&quot;&gt;Sports and Fitness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of football clubs and biking groups. A few government sports complexes and private sports clubs are also available. Plenty of yoga and other fitness activities are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;Weather&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While days from 9 am to 5 pm are quite hot and at times humid, mornings and evenings are quite pleasant all year round, including summer. It is a beautiful place in the monsoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;connectivity&quot;&gt;Connectivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goa now has two airports and is very well connected with the rest of India. Once the new airport is fully functional, it will have even direct connectivity to major European destinations. It is also well connected to parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka by road and railway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;infrastructure-limitations&quot;&gt;Infrastructure limitations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Goa does a great job of pretending to be an urban area, it is still very much a rural area.
Electricity outages, no matter what Twitter warriors say, are frequent.
Roads, while good, if they get damaged, do not get fixed as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And most importantly, you cannot live here just on public transport. The bus network is extensive, but not as frequent, and many areas are not covered due to very narrow roads. Buses are not well maintained, and the timetable is more of a guidance than a rule. There are no on-demand taxi services such as Uber or Ola, and the local taxi service is run by a mafia with poor service and exorbitant pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are going to live here, you have to have your own transport. You can rent motorcycles and cars on a monthly basis quite easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many, or most, apartments are not designed for long-term living. They are mostly designed for short-term rentals with limited storage spaces, small kitchens, and generally a bad user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;support-services&quot;&gt;Support Services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to find good cooks and housekeepers. If you do not have very specific food tastes or can train someone, then finding a cook is a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of urban centers like Panjim, Mapusa, Porvorim, and Margao, it is quite difficult to find good plumbers, electricians, and other support services. The quality of these service providers is also quite low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goa is a rural place, so do not expect the same level of professionalism you would in say Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;costly&quot;&gt;Costly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it is a popular tourist destination, many things are priced at exorbitant levels. Apartment rent, taxis, bike/car rental; the closer you are to the beach, the higher the prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are plenty of high-quality local food options available away from touristy areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;substance-abuse&quot;&gt;Substance abuse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a party place. People come here to have a good time, and most of it is centered around drinking alcohol. It is extremely hard to resist over-drinking and smoking in Goa. Most places are smoking-friendly, and a very large population does smoke. Other drugs are not as overtly accessible, but not very difficult to obtain either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are someone who has addiction issues or has a tendency to be influenced by peer pressure, you will find it difficult to resist those in Goa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culture of partying does attract specific kinds of people to Goa. If you are not one of them, you may find it difficult to build friendships, as a lot of socializing happens over late-night partying.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;people&quot;&gt;People&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like every other place, Goa has a mix of nice and not so nice people. Rural communities across the world are not open-minded, and Goa is no exception to that. Xenophobia, especially against other Indians, is quite common. I do not think Goa has a higher percentage of it compared to other rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Overall, the benefits of living in Goa far outweigh the costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I will do a separate post on just Cafes in Assagaon. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Most parties/events do not even start till around midnight. Clubs are pretty much empty between 7 to 10 pm. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/she-cries.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;She cries&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She cries.
Because she likes reading,
when it rains.
Even on a beautiful summer day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She cries.
Because tears are more familiar.
Even in a warm embrace of her lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She cries.
Because happiness feels fleeting.
But sadness will last her a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She cries.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/berlin-wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Berlin Wall Art&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-is-activism-taking-over&quot;&gt;Why is activism taking over?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look around, almost everybody is trying to be an activist. Most fields including but not limited to entrepreneurs, academics, government officials, religious groups are being dominated by activists. Why is this happening and is there anything you can do about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Activism is mostly a zero-sum game&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In fact zero-sum activism is easiest to get behind. It is a us vs them. As long as you can find simple enough grounds to paint &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; as evil, and &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; as the good people, it is extremely easy to bully people into supporting your view. You can see this bullying and how it played out in campaigns like https://internetfreedom.in/campaigns-savetheinternet/ .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is this happening?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;game-theoretic-perspective&quot;&gt;Game theoretic perspective.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let us say you and X&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are part of a (online) tribe T.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;X is very motivated by movement Z, which is not related to T.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;X tweets about Z, supporting Z and condemning Y.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now you three choices - co-opt, ignore, or oppose X.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;co-opt&quot;&gt;Co-opt&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will enhance your mutual influence with X.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your influence in T is determined by sum total of your influence with each individual member. So supporting X will enhance your influence in T.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It will enhance influence of X in the tribe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;ignore&quot;&gt;Ignore&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can continue to ignore X on Z.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As long as views of X do not become dominant view within your tribe, you are fine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If those views become dominant with T, your returns from T may start diminishing. At the very least you will not be able to greatly enhance your influence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;oppose&quot;&gt;Oppose&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have far more influence in T compared to X, then you can oppose X.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This will neither enhance nor diminish your influence in T, as long as X does not get further support from members of T.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If X manages to gain even one supporter, then your influence starts decreasing if you can not get supporters as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If both you and X keep getting supporters, the tribe will eventually split into T1 and T2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Effectively, you lose your influence by half.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on above information, you can see that your dominant strategy is to co-opt X. This is especially true if you are not very passionate about Z to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain why&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is a combination of sequential and simultaneous game.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sequential as you can wait for other people to make move, taking a small risk of losing out on being an early mover.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simultaneous as every member of the tribe can make decisions simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So in this case, if you are a new member of the tribe with very little influence. Your best change of gaining some is by coopting views of X.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a loosely organised tribe where there is no gate on membership, you can see how supporting X will be very lucrative thing to do for new members.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Especially given that it is a simultaneous game as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This effectively means almost always X is going to win, unless someone with very high influence is willing to launch motivated opposition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the reason why most tribes become fairly rigid in their views. This is how they create shared myths which are very difficult to see past. Anyone who does not believe in those shared myths is eventually castigated. You can see this any number of close-knit tribes such entrepreneurs, academics, climate activists, political activists, crypto activist, &lt;em&gt;organised&lt;/em&gt; religions, and so on. Essentially any tribe where you can not concretely with hard evidence show something to be right or wrong, you will see this same exact behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is your only choice available is to co-opt, either immediately or eventually, to support dominant activism within your tribe?
It is possibly the best and easiest choice available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now look at it from perspective of X.
X is someone who has moderate level of influence in T.
X does care about Z to some degree.
X may not be expert on Z.
It is extremely easy for X to gain really high influence in T. Even if they do not care about Z, purely from game theory perspective it is quite difficult to resist being an activist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-so-then-why-i-am-still-not-an-activist&quot;&gt;If so, then why I am still not an activist&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainly because over a period of time these tribes will become more and more extreme. What you think of as extreme, they manage to make it a normal within an enclosed world view. Then there is more activism within that already narrow world and it can only push the tribe as a whole towards extreme end. And that is the biggest worry. It is not that there is activism in the world and it is increasing at an alarming rate, but that over time all activism ends up being extremism which has a net negative impact on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-do-you-protect-yourself&quot;&gt;How do you protect yourself?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not go into fields which have become tribal in nature - academics and journalism are the most prominent examples of this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do no rely on having a strong tribal identity. Build individual relationships with people that you need help from. Avoid going to group events once you have say 5-10 people in your network. Especially startup events. Essentially any event with more than 7-8 people is not worth going to anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid doing &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; business with people who are vocal activists. Even if you agree with their activism today, I suggest keeping your risk exposure to them as low as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There are some exceptions to this rule, but generally this rule holds. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Don’t want to use any real names to avoid subtext. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I do have a dominant ethical and moral view which manifests as support for political parties or other social issues. But directionality between cause and effect is ethics to party and not the other way. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Week 9   Principles of Economics   Microeconomics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microeconomics-course.png&quot; alt=&quot;Principles of Economics - Microeconomics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;labour-markets&quot;&gt;Labour markets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marginal product of labour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The increase in a firm’s revenue created by hiring an additional labourer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declines with more labour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firms hire as long as wage &amp;lt; marginal product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/marginal-product.png&quot; alt=&quot;Marginal Product&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;education&quot;&gt;Education&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is education just a signalling tool or does education provide real benefits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Earnings are co-related with having a college degree, even liberal arts degree.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not finishing a college does not add to future earnings, even if a person leaves college in the last year. This is the basic premise of signalling argument.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Education does provide social contexts, building networks, learning skills which are not taught in a classroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;unions&quot;&gt;Unions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Western Europe despite having more unions than United States, has lower wages than the US.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unions raise wages by restricting supply of labour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unions however are not just about wage negotiating, but general welfare of the workforce which does provide value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;compensating-differential&quot;&gt;Compensating differential&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If two jobs require the same set of skills, then wages at a more fun job will be less than wages at a less fun job.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wage captures not just the skill value of the labour, but also social characteristics of the job.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Example - an optometrist in a remote Australian mining town makes far better wages than in a suburban Melbourne or Sydney.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wage also captures any other benefits derived from the job. If one job has more learning potential compared to another, wage at the job with higher learning will be less.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Typically dangerous jobs have much higher wages than safe jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microeconomics-course.png&quot; alt=&quot;Principles of Economics - Microeconomics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;profit-maximization&quot;&gt;Profit maximization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;costs-and-profit-maximization-under-competition&quot;&gt;Costs and profit maximization under competition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Profit is the main motivation for firms actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In competitive industry firms maximize profits by choosing price and quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competitive firms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Similar products.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many buyers and sellers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small number of buyers and sellers tot total.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; sellers - sellers that can entry the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Competitive market =&amp;gt; No price control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some definitions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Profit = Revenue - Cost&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Revenue = Price * Quantity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Total cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost * Quantity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marginal revenue = Addition to total revenue from selling an additional unit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marginal cost = Addition to total cost from producing an additional unit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average cost = Total Cost / Quantity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;calculating-profits&quot;&gt;Calculating profits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/profits.png&quot; alt=&quot;Calculating profits&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Price = minimum of average cost, the firm break evens. Which means all costs, including opportunity costs, are covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;entry-and-exit&quot;&gt;Entry and exit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the total demand for a product changes, new firms will enter the market or exit the market. This affects total demand-supply curve for the product based on type of industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three types of industries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increasing Cost industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional supply requires more input costs - typical in mining and similar industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/increasing-cost-industries.png&quot; alt=&quot;Increasing Cost Industries&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Constant cost industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/constant-price.png&quot; alt=&quot;Constant cost industries&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decreasing cost industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a special case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Typically the specific knowledge acquired has network effects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ready availability of specific knowledge reduces entry cost for firms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This makes it easier to build same/similar products with lower costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Industrial clusters which produce same/similar products get created to this network effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;competition-and-invisible-hand&quot;&gt;competition and invisible hand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competitive markets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balance production costs across firms in an industry so that total industry costs are minimized.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Entry and exit decisions balance production costs across &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; industries so that total value of production is maximized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Profit distributes resources and labour across industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;elimination-principle&quot;&gt;Elimination principle&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above normal profits are eliminated by entry of new firms. Below normal profits are eliminated by exit of firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monopoly&quot;&gt;Monopoly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Market power - Power to raise prices above marginal cost without fear of new competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monopolies have market power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources of market power&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patents&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regulations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Economies of scale&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Exclusive access to an important input material&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Technological innovation - temporary power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maximizing-profit-under-monopoly&quot;&gt;Maximizing profit under monopoly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/monopoly-profit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Monopoly profit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monopoly firm maximizes profit when marginal revenue = marginal cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;calculating-monopoly-profits&quot;&gt;Calculating monopoly profits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand =&amp;gt; Price = 100 - 2 * Quantity
Fixed cost =&amp;gt; 50
Marginal cost =&amp;gt; 20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This is a linear curve, with a slope of 2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marginal revenue = 100 - 2 * 2 * Quantity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A mathematical shortcut to derive marginal revenue curve when linear demand curve.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a monopoly profit maximizes when marginal revenue = marginal cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence marginal revenue =&amp;gt; 100 - 4 * Quantity = 20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving for Quantity =&amp;gt; Quantity = 20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the profit maximizing quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price at this quantity =&amp;gt; 100 - 2 * 20 = 60&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total profits = Total revenue - Total cost
Total profits = Price * Quantity - (Fixed cost + Marginal cost * quantity)
Total profits = 60 * 20 - (50 + 20 * 20) = 750&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;monopoly-markup&quot;&gt;Monopoly markup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A monopoly firm can markup price proportional to inelasticity of demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/monopoly-markup.png&quot; alt=&quot;Monopoly markup&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cost-and-benefits-of-monopoly&quot;&gt;Cost and benefits of monopoly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deadweight loss - trades are not made to higher prices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patents tend to incentivise innovation. Without patents fewer drugs will get created.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In industries with high development cost and low marginal cost, will be helped by monopoly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;possible-solutions-to-monopoly&quot;&gt;Possible solutions to monopoly&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Government can buyout patents.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prized/grants for drug discovery.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Price discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;price-discrimination&quot;&gt;Price discrimination&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Price discrimination - selling same product at different prices to different consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers segment will have different demand curves. A firm can set different prices based on each segments demand curves. Arbitrage may make it difficult to price discriminate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price discrimination is common&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Different prices for children and senior citizens for trains, movie halls, and even meals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Special prices for students.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Airlines based on time of booking charge different prices. Weekend prices. Seating classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;social-welfare-and-price-discrimination&quot;&gt;Social welfare and price discrimination&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the total output increases, price discrimination is good, else it is bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect price discrimination is price set for each each individual consumer. No consumer surplus, all gains go to monopolies. No deadweight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;tying&quot;&gt;Tying&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goods are tied. Printers and ink. Cellphone and service plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Base good is cheap. Tied good is priced at above marginal cost. Printers are cheap, but ink is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tying tends to increase social welfare. People who print less and hence do not need to buy lot of ink, get to print at lower cost as cost of printer is much lower. People who print more and hence value printing more will pay more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;bundling&quot;&gt;Bundling&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goods are sold together. Cable TV, Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each product in a bundle will have a different demand curve. For example some people value Excel more than Word. Others value Powerpoint more than Excel. Due to bundling this variability of different demands get accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand for bundle less variable than demand for each good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zero marginal cost makes it easier to bundle goods together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bundling increases profits as consumer surplus reduces and more trades are made reducing deadweight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer welfare may go up or down depending on elasticity of demands.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 7   Principles of Economics   Microeconomics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microeconomics-course.png&quot; alt=&quot;Principles of Economics - Microeconomics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;externalities&quot;&gt;Externalities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costs of trade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private cost - Paid by the consumer or the producer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;External cost - A cost paid by bystanders, by people other than the consumer or the producer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social cost of trade = Private cost + External cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Externalities deal with external cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Market does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; maximize social surplus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;external-costs&quot;&gt;External Costs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/external-cost.png&quot; alt=&quot;External Cost&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there are external costs of trade, output should be reduced.
Who bears the cost is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solutions&quot;&gt;Solutions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pigouvian Tax
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For example tax on cigarattes.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tax increases price and reduces output.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If tax can capture external costs, then it can be great way to reduce output.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;external-benefits&quot;&gt;External Benefits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits to bystanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example - Vaccine. They protect not just the consumer of the vaccine, but bystanders whose risk of infection is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of external benefits Social Value &amp;gt; Private Value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pigouvian-subsidy&quot;&gt;Pigouvian Subsidy&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In case of external benefits, output should be increased.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One way to achieve that is by subsidies trades.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is known as Pigouvian subsidy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solutions-to-externalities&quot;&gt;Solutions to Externalities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;command-and-control&quot;&gt;Command and control&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:
Government imposes strict electricity consumption ceiling on washing machines. But washing machines that use less electricity clean less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of command and control is rarely efficient. Government does not have all the information on how consumers value use of electricity. So if instead government imposes taxes on electricity, each consumer will reduce their own uses based on their individual information. Overall this will lead to lowering electricity consumption and reducing pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;coase-theorem&quot;&gt;Coase Theorem&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are bee keepers who rent out their bees for pollination services. This market place works because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low transaction cost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;External benefits can be contained, bees travel less.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Property rights are clear; Bee keeper owns bees, farmer owns the farm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pollution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unclear external cost. How much? Who and Where?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unclear property rights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Coase Theorem - If transaction costs are low and property rights are clear, private trade will ensure efficient market equilibrium even in case of externalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coase theorem suggests that a new market can be created to trade externalities as long as property rights can be defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tradable allowances and pollution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To reduce pollution a fixed number of carbon credits are created.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firms can buy these credits for certain amount.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firms which can lower carbon footprint at lower cost than cost of credit will do that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Firms which can not, will continue to pollute by buying unused credits.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;But due to limited supply of carbon credits, least valuable uses of carbon are removed from the system and this reduces pollution more efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;incentives&quot;&gt;Incentives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of external benefits, incentivising consumers will increase the total social benefits. For example a flu shot can be subsidised, hence more people get flu shot and this reduces cases of flu per year.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microeconomics-course.png&quot; alt=&quot;Principles of Economics - Microeconomics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trade&quot;&gt;Trade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benefits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trade makes people better off when preferences differ.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Value to buyer &amp;gt; value to seller for a trade to happen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specialization - boost productivity by creating skilled labour and information networks.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It is not possible to know everything about everything. Specialization reduces amount of knowledge required to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Developed countries have more combined knowledge than developing countries.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;globalization&quot;&gt;Globalization&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increases combined world knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Comparative Advantage - The more different we are from each other, the more we benefit from trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/comparitive-advantage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Comparative Advantage&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;opportunity-cost&quot;&gt;Opportunity cost&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time and resources are finite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to maximize your payoff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In two country/person examples, trade makes everyone better off, but in larger examples some may be worse off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comparative advantage applies to groups and individuals.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Diversity is a strength when combined with trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tariffs-and-protectionism&quot;&gt;Tariffs and Protectionism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Protectionism - economic policy of restraining trade through tariffs, quotas, or other regulations that burden foreign producer but not domestic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tariff - tax on import.
Quota - Quantity restriction of import.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;international-trade&quot;&gt;International trade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/international-trade.png&quot; alt=&quot;International Trade&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effects of tariff that influence welfare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Domestic consumption reduces.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Domestic production increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these reduce welfare because&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Domestic consumption reduces leading to lost gains from trade.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Domestic production increases, leading to use of resources in products where they are not as valued under trade, leading to wasted resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tariffs&quot;&gt;Tariffs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase price, create deadweight losses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Direct production from low-cost to high-cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distribution of losses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bad for consumers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Good for domestic producers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bad overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;arguments-against-international-trade&quot;&gt;Arguments against international trade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;reduces-domestic-jobs&quot;&gt;Reduces domestic jobs&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We pay for imports with exports!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trade moves jobs from import industries to exports.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wages increase on average due to comparative advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Problems do arise when low skilled jobs are lost and labour is not up skilled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;child-labour&quot;&gt;Child labour&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Child labour is a side effect of poverty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restraining trade due to child labour will further increase poverty and put more children at risk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trade however in the long run will increase wealth and reduce child labour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;national-security&quot;&gt;National security&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anything can be considered important for national security.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Key industries at home - Maybe valid for very few industries. But supply chains for those are global and hence still difficult without trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cost-of-protectionism&quot;&gt;Cost of protectionism&lt;/h4&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/microeconomics-course.png&quot; alt=&quot;Principles of Economics - Microeconomics&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;price-ceiling&quot;&gt;Price Ceiling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Price ceiling - Maximum price allowed by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;effects-of-price-ceiling&quot;&gt;Effects of price ceiling&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shortages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bad quality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lines and search costs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deadweight loss&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Misallocation of resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;shortages&quot;&gt;Shortages&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/price-ceiling.png&quot; alt=&quot;Price Ceiling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;bad-quality&quot;&gt;Bad Quality&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main effect of price ceiling is that Q&lt;sub&gt;Demanded &amp;gt; Q&lt;sub&gt;Supplied. Sellers have more customers so&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They can cut quality, cut costs and still able to sell at the same mandated price.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They can provide worse service and still be able to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;lines-and-search-costs&quot;&gt;Lines and search costs&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Price control does not reduce quantity demanded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consumers outnumber sellers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This incentivises consumers who value a good more to pay bribes to buy it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More consumers than suppliers leads to lines and increase in time cost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paying in time is wasteful as time is a perishable resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/line-costs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Line costs&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;deadweight-loss&quot;&gt;Deadweight loss&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to price control, not all profitable trades are made, so  there is a deadweight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;misallocation-of-resources&quot;&gt;Misallocation of resources&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key benefit of free market and the pricing system is that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We want to ensure that consumers who value a good more can secure supply before consumers who value it less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gold and silver are used in many electrical and electronics manufacturing. It is also used as jewellery.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If government puts a max price on gold, some of the supply that should have gone to electrical and electronics manufacturing goes to jewellery.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Manufacturers can not signal to the market that they value gold more by paying a higher price to secure supplies, as there is a price ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This leads to shortages in manufacturing and instead allocates resources for jewellery which is not as important area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Price system ensures that most important and hence most valued consumers of good are last to be affected by shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/misallocation.png&quot; alt=&quot;Misallocation of resources&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rent-controls&quot;&gt;Rent controls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is a type of a price ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Makes it difficult to find apartments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Often rent controlled apartments are rented by people who do not need them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creates shortages in supply of apartment buildings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over time due to fund shortages rent controlled buildings become decrepit, unmaintained, and dangerous. Many rent controlled buildings fall down in Mumbai, killing people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;price-floors&quot;&gt;Price floors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Minimum price allowed by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;effect-of-price-floors&quot;&gt;Effect of price floors&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They create surpluses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lost gains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wasteful increase in quality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Misallocation of resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floors are less common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;minimum-wage&quot;&gt;Minimum wage&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimum wage is a type of price floor.
Effects of minimum wage on above mentioned dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;surpluses&quot;&gt;Surpluses&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Minimum wage creates surplus of labour, leading to unemployment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who may have be willing to work at lesser wage are now unable to find jobs as employers can not pay minimum wage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimum wage affects&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only small % of workers are paid at minimum wage, less than 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large increase in the minimum wage will cause serious increase in unemployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test case&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;US government accidentally increased minimum wage in Puerto Rico, by a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Led to many businesses shutting down and a very high increase in unemployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Communism = universal price controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
