      <p>I got back from a 9 day break on Sunday. It has been a pure heaven. </p>

<p>Well I love what I do and love to be around people I am working with. </p>

<p>Having said so, there is so much of communication happening these days that its completely impossible to be give yourself a time. People pinging you all the time on chat, emails being exchanged, mobile going off all the time (well not for me as I tend to use mobile less and less everyday), landlines, twitter, orkut scraps, facebook notifications. Uff. The list is endless.</p>

<p>We all have come to a place where we are addicted to news and communication. 90% of news we consume is generally useless to us. But we do consume it.</p>

<p>For last days I checked my emails 15 mins everyday as it is impossible for me to be out of touch with the team and with clients. Updated twitter only couple of times. Did NOT even touched the god-damned mobile phone. </p>

<p>I found myself thinking loud and may be clear in my head. Though about lot of stuff. Scribbled few poems. Read couple of books. Did lot of MASTI. Endured some physical work like taking 5-6Kms walk. Swim. </p>

<p>No matter what profession you are in. No matter how many responsibilities you need to shoulder. Please do take breaks. </p>

<p>Try to be alone with yourself once in a while. There is nothing like it.</p>
