      <p>Well not a review, but few thoughts that come to my mind after seein the film.</p>

<p>But first of all, Ghajini is a good movie. Does what it is meant to do. Entertain.With amazing marketing and brand of Aamir Khan associated with it, no wonder it has become one of the highest earning films of all time!</p>

<p>So you take product developed and successfully sold in US and then remake it multiple times in India and still it is big hit. Why? As it adds Indianess to the product. Just think how many people would have watched the movie if screenplay was not adopted. If there were no songs, no herione, no item numbers? How many people would have watched if the complex screenplay from Memento was kept as it is with 2 separate tracks going on? I doubt it could have been even 10% business maker as it is doing now.</p>

<p>Lesson, creating me-too or to be politically correct, inspired products is not bad. But creating screen by screen copy of existing one is. Something which is hit in USA may not work with Indian consumers at all.</p>

<p>Bottom-line keep inspiration to level of inspiration ONLY.</p>
