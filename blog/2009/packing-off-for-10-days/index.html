      <p>After about 6 years of continuous working, I finally am giving myself a good long vacation. These last few years out of college have been a great great experience. I think I have achieved few of the milestones I set on various fronts. There are more to achieve. But more importantly there are more to set. </p>

<p>We generally set ourseleves lots of milestones and try to achieve them I try to keep setting myself new milestones to achieve every now and then too. Goal is always have something so big to do that you are just not having time to get distracted.</p>

<p>I will be in Ooty for 3-4 days and Kodaikanal 3 days. With parents. Should be fun. Taking lots of books with me. I am not really a trekking sight seeing sort of person. I mean like it. But right now what I want is peace. Time to reorganize some of the thought process. Look at all the mistakes done in last couple of years objectively and find patterns in them. </p>

<p>Gonna try and see if I get chance to study Israel startup culture and education system and if there things we can learn from them too.</p>

<p>Havent yet packed so heading home. Mangala Express to catch tomorrow at 5am!</p>

<p>See you folks back on 3rd May. Have a safe and happy time till then!</p>
