But just by taking that risk. Initially - perhaps like any one else (or may be not) entire focus was on from where next months expenses are coming. From where I am going to make money. Of many more such dirt cheap living situation before I can crash on a bed in a nice comfy apartment. How much more time before I will finally stop having nightmares about not able to make salaries or having to live on the street. After 3 years I realized making money is absolutely easy. If I can even think about running a business, I sure can make money when ever I want. Once you take biggest risk in life and are still on and about, then everything else starts looking pretty easy. Not easy - but not something you will be intimidated by. Not something which will give you nightmares at least. And after I realized that money is the easier part, I decided to take that final step. Not thinking actively about making money at all. Life seems full of much more opportunities than before. (1) - Not crores of rupees but enough to spend for a comfortable life-style with may be very few corners cut." />
