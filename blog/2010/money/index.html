      <p>Making money is easy. (1)</p>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I learned this after running a business for 3 years. Not a highly successful business. Not a million-dollar business (, yet). But just by taking that risk.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Initially - perhaps like any one else  (or may be not) entire focus was on from where next months expenses are coming. From where <b>I</b> am going to make money. Of many more such dirt cheap living situation before I can crash on a bed in a nice comfy apartment. How much more time before I will finally stop having nightmares about not able to make salaries or having to live on the street.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>After 3 years I realized making money is absolutely easy. If I can even think about running a business, I sure can make money when ever I want. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Once you take biggest risk in life and are still on and about, then everything else starts looking pretty easy. Not easy - but not something you will be intimidated by. Not something which will give you nightmares at least. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>And after I realized that money is the easier part, I decided to take that final step. Not thinking actively about making money at all. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Life seems full of much more opportunities than before.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>(1) - Not crores of rupees but enough to spend for a comfortable life-style with may be very few corners cut.</div>
