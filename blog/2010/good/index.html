<meta name="description" content="Most times we have best things heart and yet we are often perceived to be bad. As human race has evolved our minds are closing us into more and more paranoid thoughts. Because of this our mind has actually closed for things which are generally good. Most of us dont like to pause and think about things which may seem bad but might actually be in our best interest. Might have been done in very casual sense with out meaning anything. Because of this we have to focus more and more on being perceived good rather than on just being good. And being perceived good is far easier to fake and hence people can deceive you. Which will force more paranoid thoughts and more cheating. World will be much better if all had a moment to think. Eg - In India we have two major political parties - congress and BJP. congress is the one which has very successful faked in being perceived good where as BJP unfortunately a really good party has always been bad at that. Hopefully situation will change sooner than later. Tangent - If you have seen a movie click by Adam Sandler then I have always related automation of mundane tasks to automation of emotion processing. We need to stop doing that." />
