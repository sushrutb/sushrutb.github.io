      <p>Many people have written lot of things about Apple and Steve Jobs and there policies. Adobe Vs Apple. HTC Vs Apple and Apple app store policies have got worst press in history of technology products. But with 50 billion dollars in bank, they are of course not interested in listening. Here is my take on this problem.</p>

<p>Generally - when I buy a product I own that product. I can do any thing with that product. If I buy Nike shoes I can wear them on denims, shorts or with no cloths on. Nike can not bullshit me about what attire I should be wearing with those shoes. Similarly when I buy a PC, Netbook or Phone I should have complete ownership of that device. But Apple is exactly not allowing me to do that.</p>

<p>I am 28 and a programmer/hacker so I understand technology and would like to play around with my phone. Even if I can not recompile kernel of my Windows or Symbian machine like I can do with my Linux or Android machine, still I can do pretty much everything. I can install any app I want. I can install any softwares, third-party tools. I can run programs in any other language. I can watch porn if I want!</p>

<p>Apple and its terms and conditions now specify that we can not cross compile from LangX to C and run it on iEgo devices. Err.. why not Mr Steve Jobs? Whats exactly wrong with that? You are selling a phone and a phone experience or are you selling Objective C to developers? Why do you want to lock in people to a technology which you think is good? Next what - no SMS lingo when texting? All texts need to pass through spell-check before then can be sent out? Or no use of x-rated words in texts?</p>

<p>I can not install any app I want, I have to always install apps from app store. This is the most idiotic thing ever! Plus apple will take down any apps when ever they feel like.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is - Apple thinks users and developers of iEgo devices are witless dumbs and cant decide whats good for them on their own and need to police them always.</p>

<p>I personally never bought an iEgo device myself will never do so.</p>
