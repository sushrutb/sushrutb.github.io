<p>It has been four years. And everyday he woke up with a knot in his heart. Even in this faraway land. And he kept thinking of that flower and that first date every day. And that&rsquo;s what he was thinking about when he took a wrong turn and went off to a strange road. And there he saw a garden full of blossoming flowers. The same rare flowers. And he thought, may be the seed they planted together is responsible for this garden. It was their love which may have created such wonderful gardens in faraway lands without even knowing. As he sat on bench, knot loosened and he cried for the first time since she was gone.</p>
