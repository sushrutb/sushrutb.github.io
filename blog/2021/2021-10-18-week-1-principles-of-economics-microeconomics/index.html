<h3 id="supply-demand-and-equilibrium">Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium</h3>

<h4 id="demand-curve">Demand curve</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>Graphs quantity demanded at various price points. Quantity demanded decreases if price increases, as less consumers are willing to purchase the product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="supply-curve">Supply curve</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Graphs quantity supplied at various price points. Quantity supplied increases if price increases, as more suppliers are willing to supply the product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="how-to-interpret-supply-and-demand-curve">How to interpret supply and demand curve?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>If price of a product decreases, consumers who were buying products which are substitutes, are now buying the product.</li>
  <li>If price of a product increases, suppliers who were making other products, are now supplying the product.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="supply-and-demand-equilibrium-price-point">Supply and demand equilibrium price point.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>When supply and demand are graphed, equilibrium is where these intersect.</li>
  <li>In a free market, market forces are always trying to push the price towards equilibrium.</li>
  <li>If price is above equilibrium, there is product surplus as demand &lt; supply. This pushes the price down, towards equilibrium.</li>
  <li>If price is below equilibrium, there is product shortage as demand &gt; supply. This pushes the price up, towards the equilibrium.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>At equilibrium, total gains from the trade are maximized.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="consumer-surplus">Consumer surplus</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It is <em>profit</em> made by consumer.</li>
  <li>It is the difference between a maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and purchase price.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="producer-surplus">Producer surplus</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It is <em>profit</em> made by supplier.</li>
  <li>It is the difference between minimum price a supplier willing to sell at and sale price.</li>
  <li>Assuming that minimum price set by supplier includes some profit margin, this is the extra profit made by supplier.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="demand-curve-shifts">Demand curve shifts</h4>
<ul>
  <li>demand curve shifts right - greater quantity demanded at <em>every</em> given price point.</li>
  <li>demand curve shifts left - lesser quantity demanded at <em>every</em> given price point.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="possible-reasons">Possible reasons</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Income</li>
  <li>Population</li>
  <li>Price of substitutes</li>
  <li>Price of complements</li>
  <li>Expectations</li>
  <li>Tastes</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="income">Income</h6>
<ul>
  <li>For normal goods demand increases if income increases. e.g computers, phones, pubs.</li>
  <li>For inferior goods demand decreases if income decreases. e.g fast food.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="population">Population</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Demand curve shifts with changes in population.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="price-of-substitutes">Price of substitutes</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Two goods are substitutes if increase in price for one good leads to an increase in demand for the other good. demand(good1) ‚àù price(good2)</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="price-of-complements">Price of complements</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Two goods are complements if an increase in the price of one good leads to an decrease in the demand for the other.</li>
  <li>Fuel and cars are complements. If fuel price increases, demand for cars will decrease.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="expectations">Expectations</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Future price of a good will shift demand curve for the good right now.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="tastes">Tastes</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Seasonal goods, fashion, fads.</li>
  <li>Remember pet rock!</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="supply-curve-shifts">Supply curve shifts</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Supply curve shifts left - quantity supplied at <em>every</em> given price decreases.</li>
  <li>Supply curve shifts right - quantity supplied at <em>every</em> given price increases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible reasons</p>
<ul>
  <li>Technological innovations - can drive down prices and/or increase throughput without adding much more cost increase supply.</li>
  <li>Input prices - Cost of raw materials, labour, and other input resources may affect price and supply.</li>
  <li>Tax and subsidies - Additional taxes will drive up prices and shift supply curve up. Subsidies will drive down prices and will shift supply curve down.</li>
  <li>Expectations - Future demand and prices will affect current supply.</li>
  <li>Opportunity costs - If another market has shifted providing better opportunities for supplier, that will increase cost and will shift supply curve.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="equilibrium">Equilibrium</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>Free market maximizes gain from trade at equilibrium quantity and prices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does equilibrium work? Absolutely yes!</p>
