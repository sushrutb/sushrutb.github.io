<h3 id="elasticity">Elasticity</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A demand curve is elastic when an increase in price reduces the quantity demanded by a lot. (and vice versa). Flatter curve.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A demand curve is inelastic when an increase in price reduced the quantity demanded by very little. Steeper slope.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="determinants-of-elasticity-of-supply">Determinants of elasticity of supply</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Availability of substitutes
    <ul>
      <li>Goods with many substitutes have more elastic demand curve.</li>
      <li>Oil - inelastic as not many substitutes</li>
      <li>Brazilian coffee - elastic as many substitutes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Time horizon
    <ul>
      <li>Immediately after price increase consumers may not be able to alter their consumption.</li>
      <li>Overtime they may.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Classification of product
    <ul>
      <li>Broader - more likely to not have substitutes hence inelastic demand curves.</li>
      <li>Narrow - more likely to have substitutes hence elastic.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Nature of good
    <ul>
      <li>Necessities - inelastic</li>
      <li>Luxuries - elastic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Size of purchase
    <ul>
      <li>Relative to consumers budget.</li>
      <li>Low cost product - inelastic demand curve in short term. Coffee cost increase by 50% may lead to only small drop in demand in short term.</li>
      <li>High cost product - elastic demand curve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="calculating-elasticity-of-demand">Calculating elasticity of demand</h5>

<p>elasticity of demand = the % change in quantity demanded / % change in price.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>E<sup>D = %∆Q<sup>demanded / %∆Price</sup></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example
Oil price increased by 10%, quantity demanded dropped by 5%, so
E<sup>D(Oil) = -5/10 = -0.5</sup></p>

    <tr>
      <td>E<sup>D &lt; 1</sup></td>
      <td>More inelastic</td>

      <td>More elastic</td>

<h5 id="midpoint-formula">Midpoint formula</h5>
<p>To erase base point bias, we use following modified formula.</p>

<p>E<sup>D = %∆Q/%∆P = ((∆Q/Avg. Q) * 100)/((∆P/Avg. P) * 100)
                  = ((Q<sup>after - Q<sup>before)/((Q<sup>after + Q<sup>before)/2))/
                  ((P<sup>after - P<sup>before)/((P<sup>after + P<sup>before)/2))</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></p>

<h6 id="revenue">Revenue</h6>

<p>Revenue = Price * Quantity</p>

<p>For inelastic demand curve, if price goes up then revenue goes up.
For elastic demand curve, if price goes up then revenue drops.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elastic demand is price sensitive. Small changes in price lead to large changes in quantity demanded.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="elasticity-of-supply">Elasticity of supply</h4>

<p>Elasticity of supply is a measure about how responsive the quantity supplied is to price.</p>

<p>Elastic supply curve means increase in price increases supply by a lot.
Inelastic supply curve means quantity supplied does not vary much with price.</p>

<h6 id="determinants-of-elasticity-of-supply-1">Determinants of elasticity of supply</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Change in per unit costs of production.
    <ul>
      <li>If high production requires much higher costs, then inelastic supply curve.</li>
      <li>If supply can be scaled easily, then elastic supply curve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Time horizon
    <ul>
      <li>Easier to expand total production capacity then elastic curve.</li>
      <li>Expand output only using current production capacity, then inelastic curve.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Input materials
    <ul>
      <li>If input materials do not contribute a large percent of toal supply of those materials, then more elastic supply.</li>
      <li>For example toothpicks require wood. But toothpicks are only a very small consumer of wood supply. So even doubling production of toothpicks will have little impact on price and demand of wood.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Geographic scope of market
    <ul>
      <li>Narrow market - elastic. You can easily increase fuel available in one city.</li>
      <li>Broad market - inelastic. Very difficult to increase total fuel supply in the world.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="calculating-elasticity-of-supply">Calculating elasticity of supply</h5>

<p>Elasticity of supply == the % change in supply / the % change in price.</p>

<p>E<sup>S is generally positive. Whereas E<sup>D is negative. Otherwise similar math.</sup></sup></p>

<h4 id="slavery">Slavery</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Case study for elasticity of demand and supply.</li>
  <li>A christian organization tried ending slavery in Sudan by buying slave and freeing them.</li>
  <li>This pushed more people to be slaved.</li>
  <li>Organization buying slaves pushed the price, incentivising slave suppliers to enslave more people.</li>
</ul>
