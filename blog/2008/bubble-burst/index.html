      <p>Once there was a little island country. The land of this country was the tiny island itself. The total money in circulation was 2 dollars as there were only<br /><br />two pieces of 1 dollar coins circulating around.<br /><br /><br /><br />1) There were 3 citizens living on this island country. A owned the land. B and C each owned 1 dollar.<br /><br /><br /><br />2) B decided to purchase the land from A for 1 dollar. So, now A and C own 1 dollar each while B owned a piece of land that is worth 1 dollar.<br /><br /><br /><br />* The net asset of the country now = 3 dollars.<br /><br /><br /><br />3) Now C thought that since there is only one piece of land in the country, and land is non producible asset, its value must definitely go up. So, he borrowed 1<br /><br />dollar from A, and together with his own 1 dollar, he bought the land from B for 2 dollars.<br /><br /><br /><br />*A has a loan to C of 1 dollar, so his net asset is 1 dollar.<br /><br />* B sold his land and got 2 dollars, so his net asset is 2 dollars.<br /><br />* C owned the piece of land worth 2 dollars but with his 1 dollar debt to A,  his net residual asset is 1 dollar.<br /><br />* Thus, the net asset of the country = 4 dollars.<br /><br /><br /><br />4) A saw that the land he once owned has risen in value. He regretted having  sold it. Luckily, he has a 1 dollar loan to C. He then borrowed 2 dollars from B<br /><br />and acquired the land back from C for 3 dollars. The payment is by 2 dollars cash (which he borrowed) and cancellation of the 1 dollar loan to C. As a<br /><br />result, A now owned a piece of land that is worth 3 dollars.<br /><br /> But since he owed B 2 dollars, his net asset is 1 dollar.<br /><br /><br /><br />* B loaned 2 dollars to A. So his net asset is 2 dollars.<br /><br />* C now has the 2 coins. His net asset is also 2 dollars.<br /><br />* The net asset of the country = 5 dollars. A bubble is building up.<br /><br /><br /><br />(5) B saw that the value of land kept rising. He also wanted to own the land.  So he bought the land from A for 4 dollars. The payment is by borrowing 2<br /><br />dollars from C, and cancellation of his 2 dollars loan to A.  <br /><br />* As a result, A has got his debt cleared and he got the 2 coins. His net asset  is 2 dollars.<br /><br />* B owned a piece of land that is worth 4 dollars, but since he has a debt of 2 dollars with C, his net Asset is 2 dollars. * C loaned 2 dollars to B, so his net asset is 2 dollars.<br /><br /><br /><br />* The net asset of the country = 6 dollars; even though, the country has only one piece of land and 2 Dollars in circulation. .<br /><br /><br /><br />(6) Everybody has made money and everybody felt happy and prosperous.<br /><br /><br /><br />(7) One day an evil wind blew, and an evil thought came to C&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Hey, what if the land price stop going up, how could B repay my loan.<br /><br />There is only 2 dollars in circulation, and, I think after all the land that B owns is worth at most only 1 dollar, and no more.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /><br />(8) A also thought the same way.<br /><br /><br /><br />(9) Nobody wanted to buy land anymore.<br /><br /><br /><br />* So, in the end, A owns the 2 dollar coins, his net asset is 2 dollars.<br /><br />* B owed C 2 dollars and the land he owned which he thought worth 4 dollars is<br /><br />now 1 dollar. So his net asset is only 1 dollar.<br /><br />* C has a loan of 2 dollars to B. But it is a bad debt. Although his net asset is still 2 dollars, his Heart is palpitating.<br /><br />* The net asset of the country = 3 dollars again.<br /><br /><br /><br />(10) So, who has stolen the 3 dollars from the country? Of course, before the bubble burst B thought his land was worth 4 dollars.<br /><br />Actually, right before the collapse, the net asset of the country was 6 dollars on paper. B&rsquo;s net asset is still 2 dollars, his heart is palpitating.<br /><br /><br /><br />(11) B had no choice but to declare bankruptcy. C as to relinquish his 2 dollars bad debt to B, but in return he acquired the land which is worth 1<br /><br />dollar now.<br /><br /><br /><br />* A owns the 2 coins; his net asset is 2 dollars.<br /><br />* B is bankrupt; his net asset is 0 dollar. (He lost everything)<br /><br />* C got no choice but end up with a land worth only 1 dollar<br /><br /><br /><br />* the net asset of the country = 3 dollars.<br /><br /><br /><br />************ **End of the story; BUT ************ ********* ******<br /><br /><br /><br />There is however a redistribution of wealth.<br /><br />A is the winner, B is the loser, C is lucky that he is spared.<br /><br />A few points worth noting -<br /><br /><br /><br />(1) when a bubble is building up, the debt of individuals to one another in a country is also building up.<br /><br />(2) This story of the island is a closed system whereby there is no other country and hence no foreign debt. The worth of the asset can only be calculated<br /><br />using the island&rsquo;s own currency. Hence, there is no net loss.<br /><br />(3) An over-damped system is assumed when the bubble burst, meaning the land&rsquo;s value did not go down to below 1 dollar.<br /><br />(4) When the bubble burst, the fellow with cash is the winner. The fellows having the land or extending loan to others are the losers. The asset could<br /><br />shrink or in worst case, they go bankrupt.<br /><br />(5) If there is another citizen D either holding a dollar or another piece of land but refrains from taking part in the game, he will neither win nor lose.<br /><br />But he will see the value of his money or land goes up and down like a see saw.<br /><br />(6) When the bubble was in the growing phase, everybody made money.<br /><br />(7) If you are smart and know that you are living in a growing bubble, it is<br /><br />worthwhile to borrow money (like A) and take part in the game. But you must know when you should change everything back to cash.<br /><br />(8) As in the case of land, the above phenomenon applies to stocks as well.<br /><br />(9) The actual worth of land or stocks depends largely on psychology (or speculation)</p>
