      <p>As year the draws to an end, I stop and think what is going to be <strong>the</strong> most important thing for me as an Indian techno-preneur in 2009? Is it going to be the 3G communication, Rise of WiMax, Social media, Clouds or something else. But answer is as an Indian techno-preneur I will be watching very closely how the project by Government of India in which they will be deploying 200,000 technology kiosks in Indian villages and tribal sector.</p>

<p>Why is this project so important to me? Because this project can really accelerate growth of literacy and Internet literacy in India. Most of the Indian entrepreneurs so far have focused on applications and products which are targeted at metro India. These applications have not reached even semi-urban areas until very recently. Now with these kiosks, GoI is opening up wide range of possibilities for technology sector. 55% population is still in villages and around 80%+ population is semi-urban + villages based. Now reaching this population and users will be a far more easier through these Kiosks.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope this project will progress as per deadlines and will be a smashing hit!</p>

<p><strong>Happy new year to everyone. Let us hope that 2009 will be safe, healthy and prosperous for everyone. </strong></p>

<p>Please do not drink and drive.</p>
