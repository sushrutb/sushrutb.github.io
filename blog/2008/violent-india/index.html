      <p>Well thanks to all the violence happening around country, I decided to write something here. Some random thoughts coming in to my mind finding way here.<br /><br />So its about end of year. Still few days to go and I dont want list to grow any more. We witnessed violence all over. In Maharashtra over Bihari issue. In Bengal over Nano issue. In Assam, Delhi and other parts over terrorism. And just when we thought worst is over, Mumbai attacks happened. Sad sad year for Indians. I am not going to talk about terrorists, Pakistan, Raj T, Mamta Banergy and others who might have invoked this violence on innocent people. I want to talk about you and me. Victims, observers. People who want to do something but either just rant about it. <br /><br />In school we were taught the national pledge. We used to take everyday. I know it still in Marathi. How many of you know it? Doubt even 1% know it once they graduate from school. <br /><br />There are few things in the pledge.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">1. India is my country -</span><br />   India is &ldquo;my&rdquo; country. When something is mine, I have the responsibility to make it better. I dont know how many of us really understand this. Even I am not sure how to make it better. All I know is if I work hard some how it is going to help my country. If I dont do anything thats against law, against general moral/ethics, I will be helping my country. Even jumping a red light is not helping my country. Do I need to do any thing more to help the country. I can. But even if I am the most selfish person to walk (or blog :-) ), I feel if I can do what is bare minimum required of me, then thats enough.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">2. All Indians are my brothers and sisters -</span><br />   Now this is reciprocal relationship. For me to consider some one as my brother or sister, said person need to reciprocate the feeling, right? Sadly this is not happening in India. Bihari&rsquo;s want Bihari&rsquo;s railway. Marwari&rsquo;s wants marwari&rsquo;s as assitants. Marathi&rsquo;s want marathis in jobs. Is this how its supposed to be? I am fine with financial corruption. I really dont care. For me it even keeps the money flowing in the country to some extent. But moral/ethics corruption is far more dangerous. As most often or not, people will fight against each other when things go out of hand. Moral, ethical corruption always lead to bloodshed. This has been proved for years. Mahabharata did not happen because of land. It happened because there was deep moral corruption. It was not about greed of a man or group of men. It was about society which was getting corrupted. Sadly there is no Lord Shri Krishna on the scene now to help us out, or is there one? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">3. I am proud of its rich and varied heritage</span><br />   This is still so true. Only thing is now these cultures are fighting against each other. Raj T incident has had so deep reaching impact on my mind that its unbelievable. After Mumbai attack we mind less group of people start forwarding SMSes, where was Raj T and his good squad when mumbai burnt? Where were Marathi NSG commandos. All NSGs were from delhi and punjab. And what not. I read these SMSes just as I walked past hoarding saluting people like Karkare, Chitte, Dhobale. I havent cried in last 10 years but that day I did. We have become such mindless group as a country. We just need one reason to pelt stone at each other. I don&rsquo;t care what Raj T thinks and does. I hardly support in extremists. But when you forward SMSes like this you are becoming one of the extremists. Dont you think? You call politicians Thugs, Gundas, Opportunists. Didnt you also proved you are opportunists? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">4.To my country and my people, I pledge my devotion.</span><br />    To my country and my people I pledge my devotion. Hardly we do this. Muslims, biharis, bengalis, gujrathis, marathis, South Indians, north Indians. All are fighting against each other. Over land, jobs, women, water. Day by day we are going closer to separatism. As a large community with varied cultures, languages we are going further are further away from each other. It feels like Communal riots of 47 were like big bang which put in place the momentum to take us away from each other.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">5. In their well being and prosperity alone, lies my happiness.</span><br />   What can I even say about this. All we are worried about is me, myself and I. I will bash some one as everyone is doing that. So it makes me look good. We dont care to even think beyond news paper headlines as to what is going on. No one cared enough to go to Singur and talk to villagers there. But we were all bashing Mamta in the dirtiest language possible. No one tried to find out truth behind Raj T and anti Bihari acts of his. No one tried to see whats happening in Gujrath, who killed those Hindus but all were burning down Muslim houses. We are so angry, so worked up. Some people show it through physical violence some show it through online violence. Fuck, asshole have been cult words. I even read an article about how people should shove up the candles they were lighting in the memory of dead in Mumbai attacks, up their ass. I really dont know what kind of Sanskar this guy had when he was growing up.<br /><br />What we need to do as a nation? Are there any straight answers? Something tangible <br />we can do?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">All I decided to do was -</span><br /><br />1. I will never hate anyone. Be it Raj T or be it Mamta Banergy. Be it muslim, chirstian, bihari, marwari, marathi.<br />2. I will be responsible about what I say and what I do. That much I owe to my country. <br />3. I will make sure I one statement does not create hatred in my friend who might be from some other culture. <br />4. I will make sure I create atmosphere on unity around myself. If everyone tries doing that, I am sure we can achieve unity all around.<br />5. I will not say anything out of emotion, out of hatred, out of rage, out of ignorance.<br />6. I will not tolerate violence on street. If some one is beating some one with out reason. I will try to stop violence. No longer will I be a mute observer.<br />7. I will work hard. I will work harder every day till I die. I will contribute in every way Lord Shri Krishna has enabled me to help my country and my country-people.<br />8. I will spread love. Love for even those that you think should be despised. That is what Mahatma taught us and that is what is the only way for better humanity.<br />9. Most importantly I will not be divided. I will treat everyone marathi, bihari, marwari, punjabi, male, female everyone the same.<br /><br />I remember once my mentor told me that there wont be world war now in nations. Villages, towns will fight against each other. I know he meant it when he said that. I just wish it does not happen. I wish we grow up. I wish there comes some one like Gandhi/Tilak/Savarkar/Patel who can again lead us. Who can again channelize our energies.<br /><br />Love,<br />Sushrut</p>
