      <p>Most of the consumer Internet startups ideas come from need of the concept to entrepreneur. Many successful startups (even Google) have been conceptualize this way. People try to do certain things and when they do not find a good solution, they have the idea for killer startup. Fair enough.</p>

<p>But at some point, very early in evaluation, you have to realize that you are not going to be <strong>only</strong> user of the product. In Internet consumer space, you will have to attract millions of users today to be successful. And even after having such large user base you may fail to monetize it. So you have the idea. Good. But now do some user behavioral research. Do some basic market research. Which users are using similar applications. Why are they using it. Is it just cool factor? Or is it really adding value to their online presence?</p>

<p>Once you have done this research and still think your concept is worth pursuing further. Great, go ahead. But stop telling me that, &ldquo;I personally never used this&rdquo;, &ldquo;I personally would like this feature&rdquo; etc etc.</p>
