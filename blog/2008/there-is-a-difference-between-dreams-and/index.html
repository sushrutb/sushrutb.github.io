<p>Why even best of people want to do things like this. Is it just for fame? Or is it just to get tag of serial entrepreneur behind you so you can sit on some VCs investment advisory board. God knows the answers. But all I have to say is if you are not focused on one thing, chances of success are very limited. There is difference between dreaming to be an entrepreneur and fantasizing about being one. Learn difference.</p>
