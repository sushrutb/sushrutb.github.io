Yes, I have known all this 12 years ago. I knew when you first tried to seek to me.  I knew then only that you are seeking answers to all these questions. You came to me for finding those answers only, haven&rsquo;t you? But yes, you knew you have to wait. And you did, for these 12 long years. You tried to find the answers yourself. And you did find them. Now you are here to just verify the answers, isn&rsquo;t it?<br /> So now you ask me who chooses? Don&rsquo;t you know the answer? By asking this question you in fact have answered this. Yes, you are right. You have to choose yourself. Always. I never had that power. In fact you have to lead me. You are the master and I am just a friend, a guide who can only follow your lead. You have to realize this. Unless you believe you are the chosen one, I am helpless. You have to make the choice. But why do you think its so difficult to acknowledge this? Because its very hard to accept the fact that you are being loved unconditionally. No matter what you do, I will always love you. Its the most scary thing to acknowledge someone is there who loves you, trusts you, believes in you so blindly. I know exactly what you are thinking. I know you have come face to face with this feeling once, and you had run away from it. Wasn&rsquo;t there a friend who said he can trust you blindly. A friend who said he knows you will always be there for him? And what did you do, you run away from him. You chose to cut him out of your life! But I know you are friends again. I know you just needed a little more time to comprehend, to accept that you will try not to ever let that friend down. You tried to see me in such decisions. That was the first time I think you understood what it is to be loved by me. That was the time when you decided to stop seeking me for a year. You decided you want to live without actually looking for me. With out trying to pursue answers to these questions. And you did so for that one year. But we came closer, much closer than ever in that one year. Again it was your choice and your decision. I just followed your lead. We came closer because you stopped trying to bring yourself closer to me. You understood that you have to bring me closer to you. You have keep me close to you all the time and that how all these questions will be answered.<br /> Now you ask me why? Well I really don&rsquo;t think you can find the answer for that. Why somebody should feel, should realize he is meant for bigger, better purpose in life. Why somebody should think he is loved more by me than rest of the mortals? Well there is no answer to this question. But try to ask why not? Why not he should be the special one, he should be given responsibility to shepherd the weaker? Haven&rsquo;t I given each and everyone of you all the powers necessary to lead? The three divine powers of “Prajanan”, “Srujan”, “Nirdalan” . Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh symbolizes these eternal powers only. And each and everyone has them. So why you cant lead? What more do you want to take that responsibility. Why you fear failure. Why you feel are just not good enough, important enough for that. This self realization has to occur. You have to ask yourself why not you?<br /> Why do think Arjun, Radha, Draupadi, Hanuman became so special? Is it because they all loved me with out reasoning? Without ever questioning my powers, my existence. Answer is no! They all achieved greatness, because they all believed that I love them too. That I love them more than anyone else. Just remember, you are only as much part of me, as I am yours. If your heart and soul are mine then my heart and soul are yours too. What did Arjun see when I showed him the “PurnRup”. Did he see me in some gigantic form controlling all the living creatures? No! He saw himself. Because he is the one who realized he is nothing but me and I am nothing but him. He was the only one understood he&rsquo;s been loved truly and completely by me. And thats why he is so special, thats why he was the chosen one.</p>
