      <p>I thought it will be a good follow up from my last post. In the last post I talk about things I know are happening in 2009 and hence looking out for. Now, what I want from 2009, not really from technology but in general.
</p>
<ol><li><strong>Die socio-networks die - </strong>Well I am heavy user of Orkut, Twitter and Linkedin. Limited user of Facebook. Everything apart from that in Social networking should just go away. I don&rsquo;t need your spammy invitations. I don&rsquo;t need, so called, &lsquo;niche&rsquo; social networks to talk about music, movies, cricket, Amrita Rao or any other thing. Linkedin/Facebook/Orkut groups and communities is enough for me to do that. But I know building a niche social network seems the easiest way to become an entrepreneur these days. We have so far seen social networks for BPO professionals, IT professionals, Cricket lovers, movie goers and what not. Day isn&rsquo;t far where people will build social networks for Reynolds 045 Pen lovers. Give me a break!</li>
	<li><strong>High speed, low cost, high availability Internet - </strong>I strongly believe that government should subsidize Internet and not just for home use but for business too. BSNL is probably the most profitable government undertaking and Babus should do something so that it can provide connections to everyone at much lower costs. In US it costs about 10 USD/month for 4Mbps connection with Static-IP. If I have to get that kind of connection in Nasik its almost more than 200 USD/month!! Please some one do something about this. Internet is equalizer which will enable us to take on developed countries and its about time we get that for cheap.</li>
	<li><strong>Restructuring of Company Laws - </strong>Well I know its asking for a little too much and I dont think it will be done even till 2019, but I am optimistic person to the core. So Mr. Finance minister and Mr. commerce minister, please have some common sense and make it easier for us to setup companies and operate them. Please provide us some ease with laws so that we can concentrate on creating value for our clients and hence wealth for our country rather than having sleepless nights over 100s of forms and accreditions and blah blah to fulfill. Please, its not funny any more.</li>
	<li><strong>Better ways to organize online presense -</strong> So I have a blog, actually three blogs. Few more blogs focused on certain things are coming up too. Apart from that I have micro-blog ie twitter account. Orkut, Facebook, LinkedIn accounts. Lot of linkedin groups. Subscription to lot of blogs/feeds. Thinking of opening FriendFeed account. 3 Email accounts. Picasa, flickr accounts. I need a better way to manage all this. I need a dashboard, single sign-on across multiple vendor websites. Or else Google, acquire all these services and integrate them in your services stack.</li>
	<li><strong>Lesser online time and a little more offline time -</strong> Spending 16+ hours a day on Internet has really given me very less time to read, reason, think. Though I make it a point to read at least 30mins to 1 hour even today, almost everyday, gone are the days where I used to read almost one entire 300 page book everyday :( . Though I am not complaining or not even deeply sad about this. But seriously I want at least 3 hours of time where I can be alone and it has become increasingly difficult to be alone while logged on to Internet. Though I know its more of my fault and hence I will be working on this in 2009.</li>
</ol>
<p>And yes please no new Matrimony site. I have now disabled all of them on my broadband by setting up rules and told my Mom that all these sites are shut down due to no business. So please dont launch another one, else I will have to again take the pain on updating my routers rule-set. So please have some mercy. Oh yes and I will not say to new laptop too (Sony VAIO, latest model).</p>
