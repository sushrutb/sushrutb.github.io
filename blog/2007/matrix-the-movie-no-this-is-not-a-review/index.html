      <p>I had seen it when it was released didn&rsquo;t understood much of it. Saw it again a few days back. It stimulated a certain thought process within. Instead of human trapped in matrix, what if matrix is trapped inside every individual? What is all this perfect world exists with in our mind, heart and soul combined?<br />   I think there is a Neo, Morphius, Trinity, Oracle, Smith, Architect trapped inside everyone&rsquo;s mind.<br /><br /><b>Architect:</b><br /> Every one wants to be creator, guard of the world. Every one wants to be at center of the world, the world to behave, to obey, to follow the rules and guidance of ones mind.<br /><br /><b>Smith: </b><br />        Every one has the animal chars waiting to be given a free hand. Even spreading my sharing.<br /><br /><b>Oracle: </b><br />        Predictor of the future. To control it, to manipulate it<br /><br /><b>Trinity:</b> <br />        Believer in divine love. Believing in the philosophy that love is created by god and lovers are united by him. Ready to die, to fight, to kill for the love.<br /><br /><b>Morpheus:</b> <br />        Follower of the god. Believing in destiny. Living to be controlled. To follow the path, one believes to be set up for him by god.<br /><br /><b>Neo:</b> <br />        The one. The almighty. The part of god himself. One who believes that ANYTHING is  possible if you be believe in yourself.<br /><br />Which of the above is dominating your mind? Your heart? Your soul?</p>
