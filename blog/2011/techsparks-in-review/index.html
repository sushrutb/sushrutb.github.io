      <p>I attended <a href="http://yourstory.in/events/techsparks/">Techsparks Pune</a> event on Saturday, and here is brief review of the experience.</p>

<p><strong>Keynotes - </strong></p>

<p>Both <a href="http://justdial.com">JustDial</a> and <a href="http://quickheal.co.in">Quickheal</a> are amazing stories. Both journeys are of real startups, which have gone through the extreme amount of pain involved and determination needed to build companies which impact world. Most events I attend, founders who have built companies for couple of years and flipped them with out creating long lasting impact come and speak. This was a refreshing change. Kudos to Shradhha and her team for putting together such fabulous speakers.</p>

<p>I have used both of these products many times and hearing about efforts behind them is truly inspiring.</p>

<p><strong>Panel - </strong></p>

<p>Panel was very well balanced with entrepreneurs, technologists and investors being represented. But quality of questions was not great. I think events like this can find better ways to conduct Q&amp;A. Perhaps let people tweet their questions and moderators will ask best questions from tweets. Or can pass along questions on piece of paper to moderators and then ask best questions. I am sure <a href="http://yourstory.in">Yourstory</a> team will figure out a better way to do this.</p>

<p><strong>People - </strong></p>

<p>Even though each event is driven by content and people, but its people you are there to meet. And there were lot of enthusiasts in the attendee. Met some of the best entrepreneurs. Lots of useful connections, discussions and exchange of ideas. Given the quality of people this event pulled, I am sure there next editions in other cities are going to be great success as well.</p>

<p>Heck I might even attend one more event before the grand finale in Bangalore!</p>

<p>So if you are in Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad - Do not miss this event.</p>
