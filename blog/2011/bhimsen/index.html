      <p>When you grow up in India, you hear stories about great musicians, singers of the past. Even legends about them. How their singing can make it rain.</p>
<div><br /></div>
<div>When you hear Pt. Bhimsen Joshi - you become audience to those legends.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>One of the most memorable moment of my life was listening to his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhang">Abhang</a> - Maze maher pandhari with thousands of Varkaris in Pune. </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>You see thousands of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varkari">Varkaris</a> instantly mesmerized, swayed and touched spiritually. Thousands who get that much closer to their god. Thousands who may not have experienced a connection with spiritual power before, experiencing for the first time. And all this throughout the night surrounded by these wonderful Varkaris who so deeply believe in God.  And you are filled with this pure positive energy and warmth that even if for a second, you do believe everything will be fine. Rather you just dont think, you just want to remain in that place, some where far closer to yourself than you have ever been before.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Then you realize that with music anything and everything is possible. Pt Bhimsen Joshi was one such legend and he will always be.  He gave with his singing a kind of experience that you will remember forever. And his songs will make rain for you, just believe a little.</div>
